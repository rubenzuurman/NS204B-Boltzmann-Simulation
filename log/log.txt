To do: Generate plot of 4 simulations with entropy vs sweep number.

16.34
I have 4 plot of the entropy vs sweep number. Thermalization seems to happen quicker the more sites/quanta there are. Multiplying both values by 10 makes thermalization occur quicker e.g.

17.12
Observation: When N<<M, thermalization doesn't really happen since the quanta are just hopping around.
